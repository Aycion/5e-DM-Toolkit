Table Generator
 * Agnostic: can be anything as long as it's in table form
 * Components:
    - Level 0,  Net-facing:     Collect stuff for tables; leave data raw and in HTML form probably
    - Level 1,  Parsing:        Try and parse table data from the HTML with BS4 or scrapy probably
    - Level 2a, Construction:   Use the parsed data to construct a table
    - Level 2b, File I/O:       Save the constructed table or load an existing one. Loading skips the previous three levels
    - Level 3,  Table Ops:      Functions that Work with table data to do things for the user
    - Level 4,  Nit-facing:     User interface
